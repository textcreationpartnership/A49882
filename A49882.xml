            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Aming</hi> is an enchanting Witchery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got betwixt Idleneſs and Avarice; which has this ill property above all other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that it renders a man incapable of proſecuting any ſerious Action; and makes him alwaies unſatisfied with his own Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; he is either lifted up to the top of mad joy with ſucceſs; or plung'd to the bottom of deſpair by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; alwaies in extreams, alwaies in a ſtorm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſaid of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> that <hi>Nec bonam nec malam ferre poteſt,</hi> he could be quiet neither Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror nor Conquered: Thus (ſuch is the itch of play) Gameſters neither winning nor looſing can reſt ſatisfied; if they win, they think to win more; if they loſe, they hope to recover.</p>
            <p>One propounded this Queſtion, Whether men in Ships at Sea were to be accounted among the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or the Dead, becauſe there were but few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61837:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 97 -->betwixt them and Drowning. The ſame Quaere may be made of great Gameſters, though their Eſtates be never ſo conſiderable, Whether they are to be eſteemed poor or rich, ſince there are but a few caſts at Dice, betwixt a Perſon of Fortune (in that Circumſtance) and a Beggar?</p>
            <p>But ſpeculation in this particular will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, unleſs we ſhew ſomewhat of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern practiſe; we muſt therefore lay our Scene at the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and proceed to our <hi>Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Betwixt twelve and one of the Clock a good Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is prepar'd by way of Ordinary, and ſome Gentlemen of Civility and Condition ofttimes eat there, and play a while for recreation after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, both moderately and moſt commonly without deſerving reproof.</p>
            <p>Towards night, when Ravenous Beaſts uſually ſeek their Prey, there comes in ſhoals of <hi>Hectors, Trappanners, Guilts, Pads, Biters, Prigs, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Lifters, Kid-Nappers, Vouchers, Mill-kens, Pymen, Decoys, Shop-Lifters, Foilers, Bulkers, Droppers, Famblers, Donnakers, Crosbyters,</hi> &amp;c. Under the general appellation of <hi>Rooks,</hi> and in this particular it ſerves as a Nurſery for <hi>Tiburn;</hi> for every year ſome of this Gang march thither: One <hi>Millard</hi> was hang'd in <hi>April.</hi> 1694. for Burglary, and others ſince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61837:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 97 -->
When a young Gentleman or Prentice comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this School of Vertue, unskil'd in the quibbles and devices there practiced, they call him a <hi>Lamb,</hi> then a <hi>Rook</hi> (who is properly the <hi>Woolf</hi>) follows him cloſe, and engages him in advantagious Bets, and at length worryes him, that is, gets all his Money, and then they ſmile and ſay, <hi>the Lamb is bitten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe Rooks ſome will be very importunate to borrow Money of you, without any intention of repaying, or to go with you 7 to 12, half a Crown, and take it ill if they are refuſed, others watch, if when you are ſerious at your Game, your Sword hang looſe behind, and lift that away; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will not ſcruple if they ſpye an opportunity, directly to pick your Pocket, yet if all fail, ſome will nim off the Gold Buttons of your Cloak, or ſteal the Cloak it ſelf if it lye looſe, others will throw at a ſumme of Money with a <hi>dry fiſt</hi> (as they call it) that is, if they nick you, 'tis theirs, if they loſe, they owe you ſo much, with many other Quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets; or if you chance to nick them, 'tis odds they wait your comming out at night and beat you, as one <hi>Cock</hi> was ſerved in <hi>June,</hi> 1664.</p>
            <p>Blaſpheming, Drunkenneſs, and Swearing, are here ſo familiar; that Civility is by the rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries accounted a Vice. I do not mean Swearing when there is occaſion to atteſt a Truth, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no occaſion, or rather all occaſions; As <hi>God Damm me, how doſt? What a Clock is it by God?</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61837:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 98 -->Then before two hours are at an end, ſome one who has been heated with Wine, or made Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick with loſs of his Money, raiſes a Quarrel, Swords are drawn, and perhaps the boxes and Candleſticks thrown at one another; and all the Houſe in a Garboyle, forming a perfect Type of Hell.</p>
            <p>Wou'd you imagine it to be true? that a grave Gentleman well ſtricken in years, in ſo much as he cannot ſee the pip's of the Dice, is ſo infatuated with this Witchery, as to play here with others eyes, of whom this Quibble was rais'd, <hi>That</hi> Mr. — <hi>ſuch a one plays at Dice by the Ear.</hi> Another Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſtark blind, I have ſeen play at Hazzard, and ſure that muſt be by the Ear too.</p>
            <p>Late at night when the Company grows thin, and your eyes dim with watching, falſe dice are often put upon the ignorant, or they are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe coſened with topping, or ſlurring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if you be not vigilant, the Box-keeper ſhall ſcore you up double or trebble Boxes, and though you have loſt your Money, dun you as ſeverely for it, as if it were the juſteſt debt in the World.</p>
            <p>There are yet ſome gentiler and more ſubtile Rooks, whom you ſhall not diſtinguiſh by their outward demeanor from perſons of Condition: and who will ſit by, a whole evening, and obſerve who wins; and then if the Winner be bubbleable, they will inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61837:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 98 -->themſelves into his acquaintance, and civilly invite him to drink a glaſs of Wine, wheadle him into play and win all his Money, either by falſe dice, as high Fullams, low Fullams, 5, 4, 2, <hi>s. &amp;c.</hi> Or by Palming, Topping, Knapping, or Slur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; Or in caſe he be paſt that Claſſis of Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſſes, then by Croſſbyting, or ſome other dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of which they have variety unimaginable; Note by the way, that when they have you at the Tavern and think you a ſure <hi>Bubble,</hi> they will many times purpoſely loſe ſome ſmall ſumme to you the firſt time, to engage you more freely to Bleed (as they call it) at the ſecond meeting, to which they will be ſure to invite you.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman whom ill Fortune had hurried into Paſſion, took a Box and Dice to a ſide Table and there ſell to throwing by himſelf, at length ſwears with an Emphaſis,—<hi>Damme, now I throw for nothing, I can winne a thouſand pounds; but when I play for Money, I looſe my Arſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Houſe find you free to the Box and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Caſter, you ſhall be Treated below with Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers at night, and Cawdle in the morning, and have the Honour to be ſtyled, <hi>A Love of the Houſe,</hi> whilſt your Money laſts, which certainly will not be long; For as the <hi>Lamiae</hi> deſtroy'd men, under pretenſe of kindneſs, ſo 'tis here.</p>
            <p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 99 -->
In a word, this courſe of life ſhall afford you ſo many Affronts, and ſuch a number of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as ſhall in time convert both your Soul and Body into <hi>Anguiſh,</hi> and <hi>Anguiſh</hi> in ſome has turn'd to madneſs. Thus one <hi>Bull,</hi> a young fellow not many years ſince, had by ſtrange Fortune runne up a very ſmall ſumme to fifteen hundred pounds, and put himſelf into a Garb accordingly, could not give over, plaid on, fortune turn'd, loſt it all, run mad, and ſo dyed.</p>
            <p>If what has been ſaid will not make you deteſt this abominable kind of life, will the almoſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain loſſe of your Money do it? I'le undertake to demonſtrate, that 'tis ten to one you ſhall be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer at the years end with conſtant Play upon the ſquare.—If then 20 perſons bring 200 <hi>l.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, which makes 4000 <hi>l.</hi> and reſolve to play; for example, three or four hours a day for a year, I'le wager the Box ſhall have 1500 <hi>l.</hi> of the Money, and that 18 of the 20 perſons ſhall be loſers.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen (in a lower inſtance) three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſit down at twelve penny <hi>Inn</hi> and <hi>Inn,</hi> and each draw 40 ſhillings apiece, and in little more than two hours, the Box has had 3 <hi>l.</hi> of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and all the three Gameſters have been looſers, and laugh'd at for their indiſcretion.</p>
            <p>At an <hi>Ordinary</hi> you ſhall ſcarce have a night paſs without a quarrel, and you muſt either tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>Moſt Gameſters begin at ſmall game, and by degrees, if their Money or Eſtates hold out, they riſe to great ſumms; ſome have plaid firſt all their Money, then their Rings, Coach and Horſes, even their wearing Cloaths, and Perry-wiggs, and then ſuch a Farme, and at laſt perhaps a Lordſhip. You may read in our Hiſtories how Sir <hi>Miles Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge</hi> plaid at dice with King <hi>Henry the 8th.</hi>

            <p>Conſider how many perſons have been ruin'd by play, Sir <hi>Arthur Smithouſe</hi> is yet freſh in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he had a fair Eſtate, which in a few years he ſo loſt at play, that he dyed in great want and penury. Since that, Mr. <hi>Ba</hi>—who was a Clerk in the ſix Clerks Office and well cliented, fell to play, won by extraordinary fortune 2000 pieces in ready Gold; was not content with that, play'd on, loſt all he had won, and almoſt all his own Eſtate, ſold his place in the Office, and at laſt marched off to a forraign Plantation, to begin a new world with the ſweat of his brow: For that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

               <!-- PDF PAGE 100 -->the deſtiny of a decayed Gameſter, either to go to ſome forraign Plantation, or to be preferr'd to the Dignity of a Box-keeper.</p>
            <p>It is not deny'd but moſt Gameſters have at one time or other a conſiderable run of winning, but (ſuch is the infatuation of Play) I could never hear of the Man that gave over a winner, (I mean to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as never to play again) I am ſure 'tis <hi>rara a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis;</hi> For if you once break bulk (as they phraſe it) you are in again for all. Sir <hi>Humphry Foſter</hi> had loſt the greateſt part of his Eſtate, and then playing, as 'tis ſaid, for a dead Horſe, did by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Fortune recover it again, then gave over, and wiſely too.</p>
            <p>If a Man have a competent Eſtate of his own, and plays whether himſelf or another Man ſhall have it, 'tis extreme folly: If his Eſtate be ſmall, then to hazzard the loſs even of that, and reduce himſelf to abſolute beggery, is direct madneſs. Beſides it has been generally obſerv'd, that the loſs of one hundred pounds ſhall doe you more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, in diſquieting your mind, than the gain of two hundred pounds ſhall doe you good, were you ſure to keep it.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo your loſs of time which is invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and remember what <hi>Seneca</hi> ſays—<hi>Nulla major eſt jactura, quam tempor is amiſsio.</hi>

            <head>A penitent Sonnet, written by the Lord FITZ-GIRALD (a great Gameſter) a little before his death, which was in the year 1580.</head>
            <l>By loſs in play men oft forget,</l>
            <l>The duty they do owe,</l>
            <l>To him that did beſtow the ſame,</l>
            <l>And thouſand Millions moe.</l>
            <l>I loath to hear them ſwear and ſtare</l>
            <l>When they the <hi>Main</hi> have loſt,</l>
            <l>Forgetting all the <hi>Byes</hi> that wear,</l>
            <l>With God and Holy Ghoſt.</l>
            <l>By <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Nayles</hi> they think to win,</l>
            <l>But truly it is not ſo,</l>
            <l>For all their frets and fumes in ſin,</l>
            <l>They moneyleſs muſt goe.</l>
            <l>There is no Wight that us'd it more</l>
            <l>Than he that wrote this Verſe,</l>
            <l>Who cries <hi>peccavie</hi> now therefore,</l>
            <l>His Oathes his heart do pierce.</l>
            <l>Therefore example take by me</l>
            <l>That curſe the luckleſs-time</l>
            <l>That ever Dice mine eyes did-ſee</l>
            <l>Which bred in me this crime,</l>
            <l>Pardon me for that is paſt</l>
            <l>I will offend no more,</l>
            <l>In this moſt vile and ſinful eaſt,</l>
            <l>Which I will ſtill abhor.</l>
